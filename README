SASS-GEMS


This is a Maven based Gems to JAR repackaging project for sass-lang.com gem files. This project uses part of the
technique posted by Nick Sieger back in 2009 but packaged into a Maven build. 

The goal is to store versions of sass-gem.jar in the central Maven repository for Java projects to use without having
to go through all the hoops of downloading the JAR and repackaging internally.
